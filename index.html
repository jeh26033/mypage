	 <p>My name is Joseph Harskamp, though my friends just call me Joe. I reside in Northern Virginia with my wife and dog, though I grew up on a farm in Northwest Iowa.<br> I learned a lot there, like the value of a solid work ethic, honesty, and respect. Those values stayed with me, and are part and parcel to who I am. I enjoy tinkering with stuff, whether it's an old car, or a website, or some old gadget I've found, my curiousity is what fuels my passion. I love taking things apart, examining their insides, and reassembling them to work better than they did before.</p>
     <p>I love learning and growing in every aspect of my life. I enjoy hiking, video games, craft beer, board games, and of course, programming. </p>
