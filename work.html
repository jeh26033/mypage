			<p>My name is Joseph Harskamp, though my friends just call me Joe. I grew up on a farm in Northwest Iowa, but currently live in Northern Virginia with my wife and dog.</p> 
			<p>I learned a lot living on a farm, like the value of a solid work ethic, honesty, and respect. Those values stayed with me, and are part and parcel of who I am. I enjoy tinkering with things, whether it's an old car, a website, or some old gadget I've found, my curiosity is what fuels my passion. I love to take things apart, examine their inner workings, and reassemble them to a state better than before.</p>
		    <p>I love learning and growing in every aspect of my life. I enjoy hiking, video games, craft beer, board games, and of course, programming.</p>
